          Hi, I'am Sergio Moreno. <b>Full Stack Web Developer.</b>{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I describe myself as a problem-solver, I am really passionate
          about making things useful. I focus on practicality, so coding has
          been a way to find myself giving the best of me in my projects. I like
          to dive deep into challenges, breaking them down into manageable steps
          and finding the most efficient solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether it's developing a complex feature or optimizing performance, I
          aim for clean, maintainable code. I enjoy working in collaborative
          environments, where teamwork and communication can drive innovation.
          Constantly learning new technologies and improving my workflow has
          become a personal goal, as I believe there is always room for growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I explore emerging trends in web development,
          experiment with new tools, and work on side projects that allow me to
          hone my skills. For me, coding is not just a jobâ€”it's a passion that
          fuels my desire to make meaningful contributions through technology.
